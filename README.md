# 🎯This is an academic research project 
### 💻This project uses ontology based NLP in order to help the readers find what they are looking for in a short ammount of time by simply introducing few key words.
During this project i have worked on the following : <br>
* Extracting data from pdf document, preprocessing and preparing Data pipelines using external libraries and unsupervised learning. <br>
* Extracting schemas and figures as Images using fine tuning techniques for yolo v5 model. <br>
* Creating and understanding the ontology base on prepared data. <br>
* Creating an end to end web application using custom deep learning architecture with services consisting in :<br>
  * ✅Conducting a hybrid conversation and responding with intelligent answers that fits the asked question.
  * ✅Extracting the inputs, outputs and tools and techniques with detailed data like images and figures.
  * ✅Deployment of the app on multiple platforms ( Web / desktop / mobile)
